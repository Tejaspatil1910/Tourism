	<p style="color:pink; margin-right: 25px"> Darjeeling is one of the most scenic and hugely popular hill resorts in India. At 2,134 meters above mean sea level, it is 686 km from Kolkata in West Bengal. Amidst the backdrop of the mighty snow-clad Himalayan peaks, Darjeeling has been popular with tourists for its beauty and pleasant climate.<br><br>
	 You can get a clear view of the world’s third highest peak, Kanchenjunga, from the town on a sunny day. Avoid the monsoons as Kanchenjunga is not visible. Skip June, July and August and definitely avoid December and January. t is home to the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR), a World Heritage Site. Tourists can enjoy leisurely walks through the town’s quaint streets, watching the laidback life of the locals.<br><br>

Darjeeling offers a plethora of options for those seeking an adrenaline rush. Visit the Singalila National Park to catch a glimpse of red panda, rhododendron blooms or for some high altitude trekking. The park is a camper’s delight as it is largely free of vicious animals and snakes, making it the most popular family camping destination in the eastern Himalaya.<p><br><br><br>

Mahatma Gandhi visited Darjeeling  in 1925. The Mahatma completed most of the 80 km of journey from Siliguri to Darjeeling on foot. So enthralled was the Mahatma that he declared the best way to travel through such a beautiful land was on foot.<br><br>

Nestle Homestay (Convent Road, Below District Magistrate’s Office, Haridas Hatta, Darjeeling, West Bengal 734101) is a lovely place to stay at.
